# P.R.O.P.H.E.T - Market Swing Predictor

ðŸ”® **P.R.O.P.H.E.T** stands for **Probabilistic Realtime Optimizer for Price Historical Evaluation & Trading**. It is an advanced algorithmic tool designed to forecast potential future market turning points, known as swing highs and swing lows, for various cryptocurrency trading pairs using Multi-TimeFrame (MTF) analysis.

This application is built with Python, leveraging the FastAPI web framework for the backend API and standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- **Multi-TimeFrame Analysis**: Analyzes price data on both 1-Day (1D) and 1-Hour (1H) timeframes.
- **Swing Detection**: Identifies and classifies significant price swings (Higher Highs, Lower Highs, Higher Lows, Lower Lows).
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculates key indicators like RSI and MACD.
- **Fibonacci Projections**: Uses Fibonacci retracements and extensions for price level prediction.
- **Scheduled Predictions**: Automatically runs predictions daily.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly frontend to interact with the predictor.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects the API from abuse.
- **Security Enhancements**: Includes input validation, CORS hardening, and security headers.

## How It Works

1.  **Data Fetching**: Retrieves real-time OHLCV data for a specified trading pair from Binance.
2.  **Swing Identification**: Detects significant price swings on 1D and 1H charts.
3.  **Indicator Calculation**: Computes technical indicators to assess momentum.
4.  **Fibonacci Analysis**: Applies Fibonacci tools to recent significant price moves to project potential future support and resistance levels.
5.  **Confluence Scoring**: Ranks potential future swing levels based on the strength of confluence (where multiple technical factors align).
6.  **Prediction Output**: Generates ranked lists of the 3 most probable swing high levels and 3 most probable swing low levels for the next 3-7 days.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/)
- **Data Analysis**: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.org/)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Web Server**: [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
- **Rate Limiting**: [Slowapi](https://github.com/laurentS/slowapi)
- **Deployment (Suggested)**: [Render](https://render.com/)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 installed on your system.
- `pip` (Python package installer).
- A C compiler (for installing `TA-Lib` Python wrapper, which depends on the underlying TA-Lib C library).
    - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio Community.
    - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
    - **Linux**: `build-essential` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `gcc` (Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dev-under-training/prophet-bot-app.git
    cd prophet-bot-app
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment:
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install TA-Lib C Library**:
    Follow the instructions on the [TA-Lib website](https://ta-lib.org/hdr_dw.html) or use a package manager:
    - **Windows**: Pre-compiled binaries are often easiest. Search for "TA-Lib Windows precompiled".
    - **macOS (Homebrew)**: `brew install ta-lib`
    - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential wget
        wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/ta-lib/files/ta-lib/0.4.0/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
        tar -xzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
        cd ta-lib/
        ./configure --prefix=/usr
        make
        sudo make install
        # On some systems, you might need to update the library cache:
        sudo ldconfig
        cd ..
        ```

4.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This installs FastAPI, Uvicorn, Requests, Pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib (Python wrapper), APScheduler, and Slowapi.

## Running the Application

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).
2.  Run the main application file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  The application will start, typically on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
4.  Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/static/index.html` in your web browser.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be easily deployable on platforms like Render.

**For Render:**

1.  Push your code (including the updated `requirements.txt`) to your GitHub repository.
2.  Create a new **Web Service** on Render.
3.  Connect it to your GitHub repository.
4.  Configure the build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Configure the start command: `python main.py`
6.  Set environment variables in the Render dashboard if needed (e.g., `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
7.  Render automatically uses the `PORT` environment variable, which the application handles.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Welcome message.
- `GET /api/symbols`: Fetches a list of available trading symbols from Binance.
- `GET /api/predict/{symbol}`: Triggers a new prediction analysis for the specified `symbol` (e.g., `BTCUSDT`).
- `GET /api/latest/{symbol}`: Retrieves the latest cached prediction for the specified `symbol`. If not found, it triggers a new prediction.
- `GET /api/next_run_time`: Gets the ISO timestamp for the next scheduled daily prediction run.

## Security Considerations

This application includes several security enhancements:
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation and sanitization of user inputs (e.g., trading symbols).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of API endpoints using `slowapi`.
- **CORS Hardening**: Restricts allowed origins and methods.
- **Security Headers**: Adds headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.
- **Timeouts**: Configures timeouts for external API requests.
